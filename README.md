## Objectives

The general purpose of providing humanoid robots with some degree of locomotion and manipulation has driven a large portion of the recent research in the robotics community. Legged and wheeled locomotion have proven to be feasible on various humanoid platforms to support an agile mobility. Nevertheless, the robot underactuation combined with the (usually) large number of the robot degrees-of-freedom are among the main difficulties for locomotion and manipulation control. With this in mind, this workshop aims at gathering scientists coming from different domains to discuss the development of platforms having the capacities of flight, contact locomotion, and manipulation. The envisaged applications belong to the domain of interests of both Whole-Body Loco-Manipulation and Aerial Manipulation.
In particular, humanoid and flying robot control has developed along different directions.
Humanoid robot control is often addressed assuming the robot attached to ground. The development of free-floating based frameworks has weakened this assumption, and the underlying system underactuation is dealt with by means of constraints arising from the contacts between the robot and the environment.
The literature on flying vehicle control is much vaster and richer than that on humanoid robot control. Besides classical flight control applications, the robotics community has been attracted by small and versatile aircraft, sometimes referred to as Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) vehicles. 
We believe that there is a strong technological benefit in bringing humanoid and flying robots closer: a platform combining these two robot natures may have the capacities of flight, contact locomotion, and manipulation. Such platforms would enlarge the application domain of humanoid and aerial robots considerably. 
This workshop aims at understanding the feasibility of bringing humanoid and flying robots closer by encouraging discussions between scientists coming from humanoid and aerial robotics.

## Organizers

### Daniele Pucci
Daniele received the bachelor and master degrees in Control Engineering with highest honours from "Sapienza",  University of Rome, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.  

In 2013, Daniele received the PhD title in Information and Communication Technologies from University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, France, and in Control Engineering from “Sapienza” University of Rome, Italy. Since then,  he is a post-doctoral fellow at the Italian Institute of Technology. His research interests include control of nonlinear systems and its applications to aerial vehicles and robotics. 

### Arash Ajoudani
Arash Ajoudani received his PhD degree in Robotics and Automation from Centro "E Piaggio", University of Pisa, and Advanced Robotics Department (ADVR), Italian Institute of Technology (IIT), Italy (14 July 2014). His PhD thesis was a finalist for the Georges Giralt PhD award 2015 - best European PhD thesis award in robotics. He is currently a tenure-track scientist and the leader of the Human-Robot Interfaces and physical Interaction (HRI2) lab of the IIT. He was a finalist for the best manipulation paper award at ICRA 2012, a winner of the best student paper award at ROBIO 2013, a finalist for the best oral presentation award at Automatica (SIDRA) 2014, and a finalist for the best interactive paper award at Humanoids 2016. He is the author of the book "Transferring Human Impedance Regulation Skills to Robots" and several publications in journals, international conferences, and book chapters.  He is currently serving as the executive manager of the IEEE-RAS Young Reviewers' Program (YRP), chair and representative of the IEEE-RAS Young Professionals Committee, and co-chair of the IEEE-RAS Member Services Committee. He has been serving as a member of scientific advisory committee and as an associate editor for several international journals and conferences such as IEEE RAL, Biorob, ICORR, etc. His main research interests are in physical human-robot interaction and cooperation, robotic manipulation, robust and adaptive control, rehabilitation robotics, and tele-robotics.
