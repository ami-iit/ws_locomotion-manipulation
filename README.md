## Objectives

The general purpose of providing humanoid robots with some degree of locomotion and manipulation has driven a large portion of the recent research in the robotics community. Legged and wheeled locomotion have proven to be feasible on various humanoid platforms to support an agile mobility. Nevertheless, the robot underactuation combined with the (usually) large number of the robot degrees-of-freedom are among the main difficulties for locomotion and manipulation control. With this in mind, this workshop aims at gathering scientists coming from different domains to discuss the development of platforms having the capacities of flight, contact locomotion, and manipulation. The envisaged applications belong to the domain of interests of both Whole-Body Loco-Manipulation and Aerial Manipulation.
In particular, humanoid and flying robot control has developed along different directions.
Humanoid robot control is often addressed assuming the robot attached to ground. The development of free-floating based frameworks has weakened this assumption, and the underlying system underactuation is dealt with by means of constraints arising from the contacts between the robot and the environment.
The literature on flying vehicle control is much vaster and richer than that on humanoid robot control. Besides classical flight control applications, the robotics community has been attracted by small and versatile aircraft, sometimes referred to as Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) vehicles. 
We believe that there is a strong technological benefit in bringing humanoid and flying robots closer: a platform combining these two robot natures may have the capacities of flight, contact locomotion, and manipulation. Such platforms would enlarge the application domain of humanoid and aerial robots considerably. 
This workshop aims at understanding the feasibility of bringing humanoid and flying robots closer by encouraging discussions between scientists coming from humanoid and aerial robotics.

## Agenda

## Organizers

### Daniele Pucci
Daniele received the bachelor and master degrees in Control Engineering with highest honors from "Sapienza",  University of Rome, in 2007 and 2009, respectively. In 2013 he received the PhD title in Information and Communication Technologies from University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, France, and in Control Engineering from “Sapienza” University of Rome, Italy. Since then, Daniele has been a post-doctoral fellow at the Italian Institute of Technology at the Dynamic Interaction Control laboratory. Within the CoDyCo project (FP7-ICT-2011.2.1, number: 600716), he has been the principal scientific contributor and he has developed innovative control techniques for whole-body motion control with tactile and force/torque sensing. Daniele's research interests include control of nonlinear systems and its applications to aerial vehicles and robotics.

### Arash Ajoudani
Arash Ajoudani received his PhD degree in Robotics and Automation from Centro "E Piaggio", University of Pisa, and Advanced Robotics Department (ADVR), Italian Institute of Technology (IIT), Italy (14 July 2014). His PhD thesis was a finalist for the Georges Giralt PhD award 2015 - best European PhD thesis award in robotics. He is currently a tenure-track scientist and the leader of the Human-Robot Interfaces and physical Interaction (HRI2) lab of the IIT.
