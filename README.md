## Objectives

This workshop aims to bring humanoid and flying robots closer, both in their theory of control and in the physical platforms themselves, by encouraging discussion between scientists from humanoid and aerial robotics. 

The goal of providing humanoids with capabilities of locomotion and manipulation has driven much recent research in the robotics community. Legged and wheeled locomotion have proven to be feasible on various platforms, supporting a growing envelope of agile ground mobility. Nevertheless, underactuation combined with a large number of degrees-of-freedom commonly challenge the control of locomotion and manipulation in these platforms. With the recent outgrowth of aerial manipulation, these traditionally disparate communities have faced similar challenges.

Thus, this workshop aims to gather scientists towards unifying solutions for challenges in flight, contact locomotion, and manipulation. The envisaged applications belong to the domains of both Whole-Body Loco-Manipulation and Aerial Manipulation.
Historically, control systems for humanoids and flying robots have developed along different paths. Whole-body control of humanoids has addressed high-DoF challenges, but largely has neglected underactuation. Control of aerial vehicles has a strong theoretical underpinning with roots in the control community, providing rigorous methods to address underactuation. Yet, the recent introduction of aerial manipulation has introduced increasingly challenging high-DoF control problems in this domain. 
Thus, there is yet strong potential in bringing humanoid and flying robots closer: both in the theory upon which their control is grounded, and physically in the platforms themselves. A system combining aspects of both platforms may have the capacities of flight, contact locomotion, and manipulation. Such future systems would enlarge the application domain of humanoid and aerial robots, inheriting expanded versatility for future deployment in challenging environments.
