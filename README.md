## Objectives

The general purpose of providing humanoid robots with some degree of locomotion and manipulation has driven a large portion of the recent research in the robotics community. Legged and wheeled locomotion have proven to be feasible on various humanoid platforms to support an agile mobility. Nevertheless, the robot underactuation combined with the (usually) large number of the robot degrees-of-freedom are among the main difficulties for locomotion and manipulation control. With this in mind, this workshop aims at gathering scientists coming from different domains to discuss the development of platforms having the capacities of flight, contact locomotion, and manipulation. The envisaged applications belong to the domain of interests of both Whole-Body Loco-Manipulation and Aerial Manipulation.
In particular, humanoid and flying robot control has developed along different directions.
Humanoid robot control is often addressed assuming the robot attached to ground. The development of free-floating based frameworks has weakened this assumption, and the underlying system underactuation is dealt with by means of constraints arising from the contacts between the robot and the environment.
The literature on flying vehicle control is much vaster and richer than that on humanoid robot control. Besides classical flight control applications, the robotics community has been attracted by small and versatile aircraft, sometimes referred to as Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) vehicles. 
We believe that there is a strong technological benefit in bringing humanoid and flying robots closer: a platform combining these two robot natures may have the capacities of flight, contact locomotion, and manipulation. Such platforms would enlarge the application domain of humanoid and aerial robots considerably. 
This workshop aims at understanding the feasibility of bringing humanoid and flying robots closer by encouraging discussions between scientists coming from humanoid and aerial robotics.
