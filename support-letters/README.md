# Disclaimers

1. At submission time, we had not received the support letter from the IEEE RAS Techinical Committee on Aerial Robotics and Unmanned Aerial System (see the proposal). We received the letter on August the 3rd.

2. Most of support letters cite the workshop with another title, e.g. Towards Whole-Body Aerial Loco-Manipulation. This because we decided to change the workshop title at the very last moment.
